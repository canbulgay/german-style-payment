# German Style Payment 
German-style payment is a demo application for restaurant account payment service.The purpose of the application is to open the QR code on the table you are sitting on with your phone's camera and pay a certain part or all of the account with the help of a special wallet connected to the application, rather than waiting in line to pay for the account in a restaurant you go alone or with your friends.
